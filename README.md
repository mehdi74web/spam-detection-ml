Spam Detection Machine Learning Project (Internship Task)
## Project Description
This project is part of my Machine Learning internship task.
The goal is to detect spam messages using simple classification algorithms
without using neural networks.

## Dataset
- SMS Spam Collection Dataset

## Algorithms Used
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression (if used)
- Evaluation using Accuracy

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook `Spam_Detection_Project.ipynb`
2. Run all cells step by step

## Result
The model successfully classifies messages as Spam or Ham with good accuracy.
